# ODPC ProductReference

The `ProductReference` object defines a lightweight catalog reference to a data product. It identifies the product, provides the key information needed for catalog discovery, and points to the authoritative product definition through `productModel`.

<img src="/images/productreference.png" width="500">

In ODPC, a `ProductReference` is used to list, search, filter, and display data products as part of a portfolio. It should include enough information for users and tools to understand what the product is, who owns it, what domain it belongs to, what type of product it is, and where the full product definition is located.

The `ProductReference` object should stay lightweight. It should not duplicate detailed product metadata such as data access, SLA, data quality, license, pricing, support, or technical interface details. Those details belong in the referenced product model, such as ODPS.

ODPC is ODPS-native, but not ODPS-only. A `ProductReference` can point to an ODPS file or another product definition model through `productModel`.

Connections between products, use cases, business objectives, KPIs, signals, and other catalog objects belong to [Open Data Product Graphs, ODPG](https://opendataproducts.org/odpg-v1.0/). [ODPG](https://opendataproducts.org/odpg-v1.0/) defines the graphs and relationships between catalog objects, while ODPC defines the reusable catalog objects themselves.

By defining product references as catalog objects, ODPC supports product discovery, portfolio browsing, filtering, prioritization, governance review, and AI-assisted portfolio analysis.
